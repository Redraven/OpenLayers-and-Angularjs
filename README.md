Trying to check how I can integrate OpenLayers and AngularJS. 

Currently it is work in progress.

TODO:
- [x] Create simple map with ability to add features. 
- [ ] Add AngularJS models.
- [ ] Make AngularJS update a list for each feature added.
- [ ] Ability to update the list, and the feature is updated as well.
